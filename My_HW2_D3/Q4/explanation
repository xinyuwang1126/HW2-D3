b.I used Excel to generate the table because it is handy and can provide a simple while professional view. And it is to cut and paste data from the source to the new table.

d.To make it easier to see, I create “female 0-17” and “male 0-17” column in Excel by adding values of various columns. I choose dimensions and measures shown in screenshot because they are the most important ones. Using “lines” chart can display the data clearly and show the trend.
